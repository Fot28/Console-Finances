# Console-Finances

## Description

Given a dataset in this Console-Finances Project I used JavaScript to make a Financial analysis which can be seen
at Chrome console panel.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Console-Finances Project first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either bellow or on the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a Financial analysis made with JavaScript.
